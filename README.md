# Project Title: kidney_disease_classification

## Overview

This web application is designed for medical image classification using a deep learning model based on the VGG-16 architecture with fine-tuning. The model is trained to classify images into four categories: cyst, normal, tumor, and stone. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading medical images and obtaining predictions on the type of pathology present in the image.


## Features

- **Image Classification:** Utilizes a fine-tuned VGG-16 model to classify medical images into cyst, normal, tumor, and stone categories.
  
- **Transfer Learning:** Implements transfer learning by using a pre-trained VGG-16 model as a base and fine-tuning it for the specific medical image classification task.
  
- **Web Interface:** The frontend is developed using Flask, providing a simple and intuitive web interface for users to upload images and receive predictions.

- **Result Prediction:** Displays the predicted results
